# Recipe-Planner
Built a fully-featured Recipe Manager with meal planning and shopping list features using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Specific technologies used: localStorage, Drag & Drop API, responsive design.
The biggest challenge was implementing the drag-and-drop functionality and making sure the shopping list correctly aggregated ingredients.
